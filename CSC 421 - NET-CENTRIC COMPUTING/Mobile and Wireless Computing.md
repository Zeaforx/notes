# 🎓 Student Note: Mobile & Wireless Computing

**Unit 2: Concepts, Technology, and Trends**

## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

**What is this unit about?**

Mobile and Wireless Computing is a field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) where computers are not tied to a desk—they can be used while moving.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **No physical cables:** Devices connect using **electromagnetic waves** (mostly radio waves), not wires.
    
- **Distance matters:** Just like shouting to a friend, the farther you are from the source (tower or router), the weaker the signal ("cloud intensity") and the slower the speed.

## 3.0 MAIN CONTENT

### 3.1 Mobile & Wireless Computing

Although often used together, "Mobile" and "Wireless" have slightly different meanings:

1. **Wireless Computing:**
    
    - _Definition:_ Connecting computers or devices without physical wires.
        
    - _Examples:_ Wi-Fi, Bluetooth mouse, Wireless printers.
        
    - _Key Point:_ You might have a desktop computer connected via Wi-Fi. It is **wireless**, but it is not **mobile** (you can't easily walk around with it).
        
2. **Mobile Computing:**
    
    - _Definition:_ Using a computing device while in motion. These devices do not necessarily need a continuous connection to work (e.g., typing a document on a laptop on a train).
        
    - _Examples:_ Laptops, Tablets, Smartphones.

#### Key Technologies in Mobile/Wireless Computing:

1. **GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications):**
    
    - _What is it?_ The standard used for 2G networks. Originated in Europe.
        
    - _How it works:_ It splits time into slots (TDMA - Time Division Multiple Access). Think of it like a conversation where everyone takes turns speaking so they don't interrupt each other.
        
    - _Components:_ Mobile Station (your phone), Base Station (the tower), Network Switching (the brain connecting calls).
        
    - _Speed:_ Very slow by modern standards (9.6 Kbps).
        
2. **CDMA (Code-Division Multiple Access):**
    
    - _What is it?_ An alternative to GSM, developed during WWII.
        
    - _How it works:_ Instead of taking turns (time), everyone speaks at once but in different "languages" (codes). The receiver knows which code to listen for.
        
    - _Advantages:_ Better quality, more security, and "Soft Handoff" (less likely to drop a call when moving between towers).
        
3. **WLL (Wireless in Local Loop):**
    
    - _What is it?_ Connecting a home or office telephone system to the main network wirelessly instead of digging up the ground to lay copper cables.
        
    - _Benefit:_ Cheaper and faster to install.
        
4. **GPRS (General Packet Radio Service):**
    
    - _What is it?_ An upgrade to GSM (often called 2.5G).
        
    - _Improvement:_ It sends data in "packets" (like the Internet) rather than opening a dedicated circuit. This allows for "always-on" internet connectivity.
        
    - _Speed:_ Up to 114 Kbps.
        
5. **SMS (Short Message Service):**
    
    - _What is it?_ Text messaging (up to 160 characters).
        
    - _Fun Fact:_ It uses the signaling path (the channel used to set up calls), which is why it works even when you aren't on a voice call and doesn't require an active internet connection.
        

### 3.2 Mobile Communications

**Definition:**

This refers to the **infrastructure**—the invisible highway that data travels on.

**Components:**

- **Protocols:** The rules of the road (how data is formatted).
    
- **Bandwidth:** The width of the road (how much data can fit).
    
- **Unguided Media:** The data travels through the air (radio waves) rather than guided media (cables).
    

### 3.3 Mobile Hardware

**Definition:**

The physical devices we hold or touch.

**Examples:**

- Laptops
    
- Smartphones
    
- Tablet PCs
    
- PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants - older tech)
    

### 3.4 Mobile Software

**Definition:**

The **Operating System (OS)** or "engine" that makes the hardware run. Without this, the phone is just a brick of plastic and glass.

**Function:**

It manages the unique requirements of mobility, such as switching between Wi-Fi and 4G without the app crashing, or managing battery life.

### 3.5 Mobile Classification

Devices are generally grouped into these categories:

#### 3.5.1 Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)

### 3.6 Advantages of Mobile Computing

1. **Location Flexibility:** Work from a cafe, a park, or home. You aren't tied to a desk.
    
2. **Saves Time:** No need to travel back to the office just to send a file.
    
3. **Enhanced Productivity:** Employees can use "dead time" (like waiting at an airport) to get work done.
    
4. **Ease of Research:** Field workers can collect data and upload it immediately, rather than writing it on paper and typing it later.
    
5. **Entertainment:** Streaming movies, music, and games on the go.
    
6. **Streamlining Business:** Video conferencing allows meetings without travel expenses.
    

### 3.7 Security Issues

With great mobility comes great risk.

1. **Nomadic Nature:** It's hard to monitor where devices go. A laptop left in a taxi is a security breach.
    
2. **Credential Verification:** Since users aren't physically in the office, it's harder to prove they are who they say they are (Identity Theft).
    
3. **Hacking:** Wireless signals travel through the air; hackers can intercept them if not secured.
    
4. **Industrial Espionage:** Competitors stealing secrets via unsecured mobile devices.
    

**How to fix it?**

- Hire qualified security staff.
    
- Use encryption and security hardware.
    
- Enforce strict access rights.

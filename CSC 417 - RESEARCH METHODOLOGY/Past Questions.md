**Air Force Institute of Technology**

## Question 1 (25 Marks)

(a) Define Research Methodology.

Research Methodology is the systematic plan for conducting research. It encompasses the theoretical analysis of the methods applied to a field of study, including the specific procedures, techniques, and tools used to identify, select, process, and analyze information about a topic. It explains how the research was done.

(b) Questions based on Appendix One

Note: The specific paper (Appendix One) was not provided. General answers are given where possible.

(i) Identify four (4) major components that constitute the Abstract.

A standard abstract typically contains these four components:

1. **Background/Context:** A brief introduction to the topic.
    
2. **Problem Statement/Aim:** What the research seeks to solve or achieve.
    
3. **Methodology:** The methods or approach used (e.g., algorithms, survey).
    
4. **Results/Conclusion:** Key findings and the implications of the study.
    

**(ii) Spot and write down the aim of the paper.**

$$Requires Appendix One$$

_General Guide:_ Look for phrases like "The aim of this study is...", "We propose...", or "This paper investigates..." in the Introduction or Abstract.

**(iii) State the methodology employed.**

$$Requires Appendix One$$

_General Guide:_ Look for specific algorithms (e.g., Neural Networks), frameworks, or study designs (e.g., Experimental, Survey) mentioned in the Abstract or Methodology section.

**(iv) Enumerate result of the proposed model.**

$$Requires Appendix One$$

_General Guide:_ Look for performance metrics (accuracy percentages, efficiency rates) in the Abstract or Results section.

(v) List any five (5) major sections in the paper.

Most academic papers follow this standard structure:

1. Abstract
    
2. Introduction
    
3. Literature Review (or Related Works)
    
4. Methodology (or Materials and Methods)
    
5. Results and Discussion
    
6. Conclusion
    
7. References
    

**(vi) What is the type of paper shown in Appendix one (1)?**

$$Requires Appendix One$$

_General Guide:_ It is likely a **Journal Article** or **Conference Paper** based on the description of identifying articles in the question prompt.

(vii) Define plagiarism.

Plagiarism is the act of presenting someone else's work, ideas, thoughts, or expressions as your own, with or without their consent, by incorporating it into your work without full acknowledgement or proper citation.

**(viii) Explain three (3) types of plagiarism.**

1. **Direct (Verbatim) Plagiarism:** Copying text word-for-word from a source without quotation marks or attribution.
    
2. **Mosaic (Patchwork) Plagiarism:** Borrowing phrases from a source without using quotation marks, or finding synonyms for the author's language while keeping to the same general structure and meaning.
    
3. **Self-Plagiarism:** Re-using significant, identical, or nearly identical portions of one's own previously published work without acknowledging that one is doing so or citing the original work.
    

(ix) What do you understand by 'reinventing the wheel'?

In research, "reinventing the wheel" means duplicating a basic method, technology, or theory that has already been created, optimized, or accepted by others. Literature reviews are conducted specifically to avoid this, ensuring researchers build upon existing knowledge rather than repeating work that has already been done.

## Question 2 (15 Marks)

(a) Discuss the two main classifications of Research.

Research is broadly classified into two main categories based on purpose:

1. **Basic (Fundamental/Pure) Research:** This research is driven by curiosity and a desire to expand knowledge. It is theoretical in nature and does not necessarily seek to solve an immediate practical problem (e.g., understanding the structure of an atom).
    
2. **Applied Research:** This research is designed to solve specific, practical problems affecting an individual or group. It uses the knowledge gained from basic research to develop solutions, technologies, or interventions (e.g., developing a cure for a specific disease).
    

(b) Provide the meaning of the acronym 'SMART'.

In the context of research objectives, SMART stands for:

- **S** - Specific
    
- **M** - Measurable
    
- **A** - Achievable (or Attainable)
    
- **R** - Relevant (or Realistic)
    
- **T** - Time-bound
    

(c) What is Literature Review?

A literature review is a comprehensive survey of scholarly sources (books, journals, articles) on a specific topic. It provides an overview of current knowledge, identifies relevant theories and methods, and highlights gaps in existing research that the new study aims to fill.

**(d) Identify any five (5) online repositories used for searching articles.**

1. Google Scholar
    
2. IEEE Xplore
    
3. ACM Digital Library
    
4. ResearchGate
    
5. ScienceDirect (Elsevier)
    
6. PubMed
    
7. Scopus
    

## Question 3 (15 Marks)

**(a) List any six (6) headings of a research proposal.**

1. Title
    
2. Introduction / Background of the Study
    
3. Statement of the Problem
    
4. Aims and Objectives
    
5. Significance of the Study
    
6. Methodology
    
    (Others include: Scope/Delimitations, Literature Review, Project Timeline/Gantt Chart).
    

**(b) Discuss the contents of each heading listed in (a).**

1. **Title:** Concise and descriptive summary of the main topic of the research.
    
2. **Introduction:** Sets the context for the research, introduces the general topic, and leads into the specific problem.
    
3. **Statement of the Problem:** A clear description of the specific issue or gap in knowledge that the research seeks to address.
    
4. **Aims and Objectives:** Broad statements of what you hope to accomplish (aims) and specific, measurable steps you will take to achieve them (objectives).
    
5. **Significance of the Study:** Explains why the research is important, who will benefit from it, and how it contributes to the field.
    
6. **Methodology:** Outlines the research design, data collection methods, and analytical tools that will be used to conduct the study.
    

**(c) Differences between Primary and Secondary Data.**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**S/N**|**Primary Data**|**Secondary Data**|
|1|**Definition:** Data collected originally by the researcher for a specific purpose.|**Definition:** Data already collected by others for a different purpose.|
|2|**Source:** Surveys, interviews, experiments, observations.|**Source:** Government publications, websites, books, journal articles, internal records.|
|3|**Cost:** Expensive to collect.|**Cost:** Economical (often free or low cost).|
|4|**Time:** Time-consuming to gather.|**Time:** Quick to access and retrieve.|
|5|**Accuracy:** Usually more accurate and reliable for the specific study.|**Accuracy:** May not be as accurate or up-to-date; requires verification.|
|6|**Relevance:** tailored specifically to the research problem.|**Relevance:** May need adjustment or filtering to fit the current research needs.|

## Question 4 (15 Marks)

**(a) Differentiate between the following concepts:**

**(i) Dependent and Independent Variables:**

- **Independent Variable (IV):** The variable that is changed or controlled in a scientific experiment to test the effects on the dependent variable. It is the "cause."
    
- **Dependent Variable (DV):** The variable being tested and measured in a scientific experiment. It changes based on the manipulation of the independent variable. It is the "effect."
    
- **Example:** In a study aiming to find out how sunlight affects plant growth, the **amount of sunlight** is the Independent Variable (the cause you control), and the **height of the plant** is the Dependent Variable (the effect you measure).
    

**(ii) Qualitative and Quantitative Research:**

- **Quantitative Research:** Focuses on quantifying the problem by way of generating numerical data or data that can be transformed into usable statistics. It uses structured collection methods (surveys, experiments) and statistical analysis.
    
    - _Example:_ A clinical trial measuring the efficacy of a new drug by recording the percentage reduction in blood pressure across a sample of 1,000 patients.
        
- **Qualitative Research:** Focuses on understanding underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations. It provides insights into the problem or helps to develop ideas or hypotheses. It uses unstructured or semi-structured techniques (interviews, focus groups, observations).
    
    - _Example:_ Conducting in-depth interviews with patients to understand their subjective experiences of side effects and how the treatment impacts their daily quality of life.
        

**(b) Using the paper in Appendix One (1)...**

**(i) What do you understand by Precision and Recall?**

- **Precision:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. It answers: "Of all the instances identified as positive, how many were actually positive?"
    
    - _Formula: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)_
        
- **Recall (Sensitivity):** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class. It answers: "Of all the actual positive instances, how many did we identify?"
    
    - _Formula: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)_
        

**(ii) Was the research qualitative, quantitative or mixed?**

$$Likely Quantitative$$

Since the question asks about **Precision and Recall** (statistical metrics) and the earlier questions asked about "Experimental Results," the research is almost certainly **Quantitative**.

## Question 5 (15 Marks)

(a) Define Research Philosophy.

Research philosophy refers to the set of beliefs and assumptions regarding the development of knowledge. It outlines how a researcher views the world (ontology) and how they understand knowledge (epistemology), which directly influences the research strategy and methods chosen.

**(b) Discuss the three (3) types of Research Philosophy.**

1. **Positivism:** Believes in a single, objective reality that can be observed and measured scientifically. Positivists prefer quantitative methods, large samples, and testing hypotheses to discover general laws (typical in natural sciences).
    
2. **Interpretivism:** Believes that reality is subjective and socially constructed by individuals. Interpretivists focus on understanding meanings, human experiences, and social contexts. They prefer qualitative methods like interviews and observations (typical in social sciences).
    
3. **Pragmatism:** Rejects the forced choice between positivism and interpretivism. It focuses on "what works" to solve the research problem. Pragmatists believe the research question is the most important factor and will use whatever methods (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed) are best suited to answer it.
    

**(c) What philosophy did the research in Appendix one (1) adopted?**

$$Requires Appendix One, but likely Positivism$$

If the paper involves experimental results, models, and metrics like precision/recall (as implied by Q4), it likely adopted a **Positivist** philosophy, which relies on objective measurement and statistical analysis.

## Question 6 (15 Marks)

**(a) List any five (5) ingredients of Research Methodology.**

1. Research Design (The blueprint)
    
2. Population and Sampling (Who is being studied)
    
3. Data Collection Instruments (Questionnaires, Hardware, etc.)
    
4. Data Collection Procedure (How data was gathered)
    
5. Data Analysis Techniques (Statistical tools, Algorithms)
    

**(b) Discuss the five (5) steps involved in a research process.**

1. **Problem Identification:** Locating a specific gap in knowledge or a problem that needs solving.
    
2. **Literature Review:** Studying existing work to understand the context and ensure the problem hasn't already been solved.
    
3. **Research Design/Formulation:** Deciding on the strategy (experimental, survey, etc.) and creating the plan.
    
4. **Data Collection:** The actual gathering of information or running of experiments.
    
5. Data Analysis & Interpretation: Processing the data to find patterns and drawing conclusions based on the findings.
    
    (6. Reporting/Publication is often the final step).
    

**(c) Define the following terms:**

(i) Research: A systematic inquiry to describe, explain, predict, and control the observed phenomenon.

(ii) Problem Statement: A concise description of an issue to be addressed or a condition to be improved upon.

(iii) Closed-ended questions: Questions that restrict the respondent to a fixed set of alternatives (e.g., Yes/No, Multiple Choice). They are easy to analyze statistically.

(iv) Open-ended questions: Questions that allow respondents to answer in their own words, providing rich, qualitative detail but being harder to analyze.

(v) Research questions: Specific questions that the research study sets out to answer. They guide the literature search, data collection, and analysis.
